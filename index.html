            <h3>What makes BTS #1?</h3>
            <p>
              There are many appeals to BTS. Good music that transcends genre is
              only icing on the cake. They're also extremely talented
              performers, have uplifting messages in their music, speak up on
              important issues, and have built an organic bond with their
              fans.-The Grammy
            </p>
            <p>
              BTS is liked by people because of their down to earth behaviour
              and their music, their vocals. Their achievements are majorly
              because of music and the songs they make. They write their own
              lyrics and produce their own song. They sometimes do get help from
              the world renowned producers.-Quora
